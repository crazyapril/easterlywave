# easterlywave
Personal project. `easterlywave` is a website hosting some interesting maps/plots under construction. It's written by Python and Django. This repository only includes the backend part, the frontend is in another repository, `ew.js`.

Currently, I am working on these webapps:
- `weather` ECMWF time series data from www.windy.com for specific locations, hourly weather observations in China.
- `sate` Himawari-8 target area/floater imagery, ECMWF cyclone ecsemble tracks, RTOFS SST.
- `model` ECMWF model forecast plots.
- `percipstat` collecting daily percipitation summary of provincal capitals of China. (`bots.py`, a crucial tool for auto-post reports, remains private due to security concerns.)
- `blog` a place for my words.

Any contribution is bigly appreciated!
